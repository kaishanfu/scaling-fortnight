Docker is a truly awesome tools, much less weighted than the virtual machines, I love to use it.

But it has its own security vulnerability, one big issue is container may share the same user namespace with
the host.

User namespace basically means the uid/gid, you can obtain anyone's uid/gid by using the id command
%id
uid=977(mulin) gid=500(rnd) groups=500(rnd)

or
%id another_user's_login

with the uid/gid in hand, one may be able to start a container and mount the host /home directory such as

%docker run ‐‐rm ‐u some_uid:some_gid ‐v /home:/home ‐it centos

Opps, now the uid/gid security measure is circumvented. Big security risk, imaging docker is intended to be
used by multi tenants ...

To fix this problem,

Docker 1.10 supports user namespace at daemon level by using ‐‐userns‐remap to prevent uid/gid leak.

effectively, a 0:0 uid/gid such as root in container will be mapped to a range offset such as 4000:4000.
